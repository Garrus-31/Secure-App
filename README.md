# Secure-App

This project involved securing an intentionally vulnerable Java Application. Doing this required conducting SAST and DAST using different state-of-the-art tools. SonarQube and Snyk Code were used for SAST, while OWASP Zap was used for DAST. After completing the security testing, a manual code review was also performed to find and fix any potential security flaws.
